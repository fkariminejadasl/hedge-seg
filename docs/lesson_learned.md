## MapTR lessons

BEV resolution: MapTR-tiny uses a 30 cm BEV cell size over a (30 x 60) m area, giving a (100 x 200) BEV grid (`projects/configs/maptr/maptr_tiny_r50_24e.py`). MapTR-nano uses 75 cm cells, giving a (40 x 80) grid. 

The decoder uses self-attention among hierarchical instance and point queries, and deformable cross-attention from these queries to the BEV features.

A coarse BEV token may summarize several nearby polylines. The important factor is the spatial granularity of the BEV features. If downsampling removes the polylines’ relative positions, and that information is not retained in the feature channels, the decoder cannot reliably separate or localize them.

Having more polylines than BEV tokens is not inherently a problem because there is no one-token-per-polyline assignment. Each hierarchical point query can sample multiple BEV locations, and multiple queries can use overlapping BEV features. The polylines remain distinguishable only if those features preserve enough spatial information about them.


## Why extra losses cause a zigzag (and why only poly + class overfits)

The problem: the model predicts 20 points per line, but the points come out in the
wrong order, so the line looks like a zigzag around the right place.

Main idea: only the ordered point loss (poly L1) knows which point is point 0, point 1,
and so on. All the other losses do not care about the order of the points. A zigzag makes them just as happy as a straight line. So the other losses cannot fix the order, and their gradients cover up the one loss that can.

Think of 20 numbered beads that should sit on a straight wire, in order.

| Loss | What it checks | Effect on a zigzag |
|---|---|---|
| **Ordered L1** (poly) | each bead k must go to its own target spot k | the only loss that cares about order. On its own it fixes the line, so the model overfits. |
| **Box** (L1 / gIoU) | the outer rectangle around the points | does not care about order. Any shape that fills the same rectangle gets the same score, and it only moves the corner points. This is the main cause (removing it helped). |
| **Length** | the distance between neighbor points | any zigzag with the right spacing scores zero. Early in training it spreads the points in random directions, which starts the zigzag. |
| **Direction** (1 - cos angle) | the angle of each small piece | if fully satisfied it gives a straight line, so it does not prefer a zigzag. It is not a main cause (changing it did not help). |

## Why the ordered loss cannot fix the zigzag

The box and length losses are happy with a zigzag, so the ordered loss is the only one
that complains, and it gets outvoted:

- Forward/backward switching: A line has two ends, and reading its points from
either end describes the same line. So the loss matches the prediction to the ground
truth read forward or read backward, whichever is closer. A clean line clearly matches
one way, so the choice is stable. A zigzag sits evenly on both sides of the true line,
so both readings are about equally close and the model keeps switching. Each switch
sends a point's target to the opposite end of the line. Point 3 is told "go to the top"
one step and "go to the bottom" the next step, so the two orders cancel and every point
drifts to the middle. The order never settles.

- Gradient clipping: When two points sit almost on top of each other, the direction
loss gradient becomes very large. The gradient clipping then shrinks the whole gradient, including the ordered loss that would fix the order. This is why the loss keeps going down very slowly for thousands of epochs but never finishes.

Note: the direction loss has zero gradient when a piece points exactly forward (0 degrees) or exactly backward (180 degrees). That is true for the formula, but it only happens at those exact angles. Real zigzag pieces sit at in-between angles where the gradient is fine, so this is not the real cause here.

## The rule

The order of the points can only come from a loss that checks each point by its number.
The box, length, and direction losses do not check the order, so they should only be small
extra helpers on top of a strong ordered loss, never large.

MapTR agrees. Its recipe is: class loss plus ordered point loss at weight 5.0, direction
at a tiny 0.005, and no length or box loss at all. This matches the experiments: poly plus
class (plus aux) overfits, and adding box or length brings back the zigzag.

## What makes MapTR-style point queries work

Two more lessons, both confirmed in the code:

- Per-layer reference-point refinement plus dynamic query position: Each decoder layer
   does not predict the points from scratch. It starts from the current reference points and
   predicts a small correction, so the points get sharper layer by layer. At each layer the
   query position is rebuilt from the current reference point, so the attention knows where
   each point sits right now. This is the main reason MapTR-style point queries learn fast.

- The query content is learned, not only the query position: Each query has two learned
   parts: one for position (query_pos) and one for content (query_content, the starting input
   to the decoder). In plain DETR the content input starts at zero and only the position is
   learned. In MapTR both are learned (see `_build_hierarchical_queries`, where the query
   embedding is split into query_pos and query_content).

   This may help because the learned content gives each point query a starting hint
   about which point it is and how it relates to the other points in the same line,
   instead of starting from a zero vector.


## Lessons

- The polyline loss is an average L1 error per coordinate, taken over every point of
  every matched line. Points are normalized to [0,1] by the padded image size
  (pad_to - 1 = 1023), so multiplying the loss by 1023 turns it back into pixels.
  A loss of 0.004 is therefore about 4 pixels of error per coordinate, which at
  25 cm per pixel is about 1 meter on the ground. Note this is per coordinate, with
  x and y averaged separately, so the real distance from a predicted point to its
  target is somewhat larger, up to about 1.4 times.


## A zigzag early in training that fixes itself is normal

Seen in the working UNet runs: the lines look like a zigzag in the first epochs, then
become clean later. This is expected and is not a problem.

- At the start, all 20 points of a line begin near the same reference point, in no real
  order, so the first predictions look tangled.
- The ordered point loss plus the per-layer refinement then sort the points into order,
  and the zigzag goes away.

This is different from the old broken zigzag, which never went away. That one was held in
place because the box and length losses were happy with a zigzag. In these runs all the
geometric losses are set to 0 (only class + point L1 + aux are on), so nothing holds a
zigzag, and any early one clears up.

So the length loss idea is not the cause. The early zigzag is just the starting
state before the order is learned. A zigzag only becomes a real problem when a loss that
does not care about point order is strong enough to keep it.

## Why ordered L1 is preferable to a tolerance loss

With approximately 100,000 polylines whose ground-truth noise is mostly unbiased, L1 regression learns the conditional median. Random annotation errors therefore tend to average out, and the model may predict the true visible hedge location more accurately than some individual labels.

A tolerance band, where the loss becomes zero within ±ε, does not correct a systematic offset in the ground truth. It only declares a range of positions acceptable. It also removes the gradient near the target, exactly where the model is refining point placement and point ordering. Since ordered point loss is the main signal that teaches each predicted point its correct position in the sequence, weakening it may leave small zigzags, swapped points, or imprecise geometry.

Therefore, keep the standard ordered L1 loss for training. During inference and evaluation, compare predictions using buffered precision and recall at several tolerances, such as 1 m, 5 m, 10 m, and 15 m. This allows the evaluation to account for annotation uncertainty without weakening the training signal.

## A closed ring can have a near-duplicate point right after the start too

Opening a closed ring by dropping only the last point assumes the ring is
otherwise clean. In pdok_dataset3, 14 of 302 closed rings (4.6%) also have a
near-duplicate point right after the start (or before the end), e.g.
`[p0, p0+eps, ..., pN-eps, p0]`. Dropping only the last point still leaves a
near-zero-length first segment, which behaves like the box/length-loss
failure mode: a degenerate segment with an almost-undefined direction.

Fix: collapse consecutive near-duplicate points (within closed_eps_px) before
checking whether the ring is closed, then drop the last point
(`open_closed_ring` in `scripts/data/convert_pdok_polylines_to_detr_polyline.py`).
Verified on the full dataset: 0 rings left with a near-zero segment after the
fix, versus 12 before.

## Why block_m = 5000 m for the geographic split

The block size only has to satisfy two things: much larger than the 250 m
crop, so blocks and overlap groups do not fight each other, and small enough
that there are many blocks to hash, so the achieved val fraction lands near
the target. At 30k crops spread over the Netherlands, 5 km blocks give 19.1%
val against a 20% target, which is close enough. There is no optimum here; if
the exact fraction ever matters, the fix is to retry seeds until the achieved
fraction is within a tolerance, not to tune the block size.

## Length filters must be checked on the stored polyline

The converter first filters raw polylines by length, then resamples them to
20 equidistant points. `resample_polyline_equidistant` rounds coordinates to
0.1 px, so a polyline sitting right on the threshold (40.006 px) can end up a
hair below it (39.9997 px) after resampling. Two polylines in pdok_dataset3
did exactly this and were stored despite being under the threshold.

Fix: re-check the length after resampling, since the resampled polyline is
what training actually sees. Border clipping was verified not to change
lengths (0 of 13,416 polylines), so the check after resampling is enough.

## Regenerating a split must delete the old outputs

The converter writes `polylines/{train,val}/*.npz`. Re-running it with
different split settings (for example after enabling `avoid_label_dirs`) can
move a crop from val to train, but the stale copy in the other directory
survives, so the same image ends up in both splits. This is silent: 30,004
files were written for 30,000 images, with 4 stems duplicated.

Fix: delete existing NPZs in both split directories before writing. This was
caught by `verify_no_split_overlap` in `exps/quantify_geographic_crop_overlap_pdok_dataset3.py`,
which is a good argument for keeping such checks as asserts in the analysis
scripts rather than as one-off manual checks.

## Done

Phase A — data + split:

- Converter opens closed rings (with the near-duplicate-point fix above) and
  raises min_length_px to 40 px (10 m).
- Geographic train/val split from center_world: crops grouped into 5 km
  blocks, blocks hashed into train/val, connected components of overlapping
  crops assigned as a whole, KDTree-verified zero overlap. Rationale for
  needing this: pdok_dataset3 crops are sampled per polyline, so 72.6% of
  crops overlap at least one other crop, and a naive random 80/20 split lets
  68.5% of val crops overlap a training crop (`exps/quantify_geographic_crop_overlap_pdok_dataset3.py`).
- Training script reads train/val from the split directories instead of an
  internal random split.
- Converted dataset3 (30k images): train=24,257, val=5,743 (19.1%),
  103,432 polylines kept, 3,380 dropped as short, 302 rings opened, spot
  checked via 20 GT overlays. Stats reproducible with
  `exps/dataset_stats.py` and `exps/quantify_geographic_crop_overlap_pdok_dataset3.py`.
- `hedge_seg/paths.py` resolves DATA_ROOT / EXP_ROOT / CLUSTER_EXP_ROOT from
  a filesystem marker, so scripts no longer need path edits when moving
  between the local machine and the cluster.

## TODO

Phase B — baseline on a ~5k spatially-blocked subset of dataset3's train
split, evaluated on the full val split (frozen backbone, augment on,
scheduler enabled, eval_every=5), plus the buffered precision/recall metric
so results are comparable to the YOLO-seg result (80% precision, 70% recall).

For the baseline, use a subset of dataset3 with the blocked split rather than
dataset2: it is consistent with the eventual 30k run, and the backbone was
trained on dataset2-derived data, so dataset2 val images also leak through
the frozen backbone features. (Dataset3 likely overlaps dataset2
geographically too, but that is a second-order effect.)

Note: the spatial split will make the first val numbers look worse than a
random split would have. That is expected; they are the real baseline to
improve from.

Phase C — decoupled self-attention as a clean A/B while the baseline trains
(regression-tested with the one-image overfit).

Phase D — results-driven: full 30k run, backbone unfreezing with low lr, and
tolerance-loss/border-filtering only if the error analysis points at them.
